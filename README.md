# üå©Ô∏è How I Passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

Hey there! I'm Bushra ‚Äî and in May 2025, I officially passed the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam ü•≥  
This README shares **how I studied**, the **resources I used**, and the **strategies to help me efficiently remember aws services/tools**.

## üß† My Study Strategy

I implemented an **active recall** approach to learning:

- Completed all hands-on labs 
- Created **flashcards in Quizlet** with past paper questions so i have to actively recall and remember what each aws service did 
- Reviewed **wrong answers** to identify weak spots and revisit those topics

This helped me learn faster and retain the concepts more effectively.

## üìö Resources I Used

Here are the courses and tools that made a big difference:

## üß† My Flashcard Workflow

I made my own **Quizlet flashcards** based on each section of the course.  
I went through all the past papers and collected all questions on one specific topic and collected them all in one deck:

> Each topic of  Stephane Maarek's course had its own deck with all the questions relevant to that topic
